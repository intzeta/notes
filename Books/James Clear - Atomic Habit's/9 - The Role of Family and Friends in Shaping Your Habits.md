**Laszlo was a firm believer in hard work. In fact, it was all he believed in: he**
**completely rejected the idea of innate talent. He claimed that with deliberate**
**practice and the development of good habits, a child could become a genius in**
**any field. His mantra was “A genius is not born, but is educated and trained.”** 

**Klara was a teacher and, although she may not have been as**
**adamant as Laszlo, she also believed that with proper instruction, anyone could**
**advance their skills.**

**Laszlo decided chess would be a suitable field for the experiment, and he laid**
**out a plan to raise his children to become chess prodigies. The kids would be**
**home-schooled, a rarity in Hungary at the time. The house would be filled with**
**chess books and pictures of famous chess players. The children would play**
**against each other constantly and compete in the best tournaments they could**
**find. The family would keep a meticulous file system of the tournament history**
**of every competitor the children faced. Their lives would be dedicated to chess.**

## **The Seductive Pull Of Social Norms**

**In many ways, these social norms are the invisible rules that guide your behavior each day. You’re always keeping them in mind, even if they are at the not top of your mind. Often, you follow the habits of your culture without thinking, without questioning, and sometimes without remembering.**

**We imitate the habits of three groups in particular:**

1. **The close.**
2. **The many.**
3. **The powerful.**

#### **Imitating the Close**


**We pick up habits from the people around us. We copy the way our parents**
**handle arguments, the way our peers flirt with one another, the way our**
**coworkers get results.**

**Our friends and family provide a sort of invisible peer pressure that**
**pulls us in their direction.**
**Of course, peer pressure is bad only if you’re surrounded by bad influences.**
**When astronaut Mike Massimino was a graduate student at MIT, he took a small**
**robotics class. Of the ten people in the class, four became astronauts. If your**
**goal was to make it into space, then that room was about the best culture you**
**could ask for.**

**If you are surrounded by**
**fit people, you’re more likely to consider working out to be a common habit. If**
**you’re surrounded by jazz lovers, you’re more likely to believe it’s reasonable to**
**play jazz every day. Your culture sets your expectation for what is “normal.”**
**Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself.**
**You’ll rise together.**
**To make your habits even more attractive, you can take this strategy one step**
**further.**
**Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2)**
**you already have something in common with the group.**

#### **Imitating the Many**


**![[conformingtosocialnorms.png]]**
**The group would be shown one card with a line on it and then a second card**
**with a series of lines. Each person was asked to select the line on the second card**
**that was similar in length to the line on the first card. It was a very simple task.**
**Here is an example of two cards used in the experiment.**

**First, there would be some easy trials where everyone agreed on the correct line. After a few rounds, the participants were shown a test that was just as obvious as the previous ones, except the actors in the room would select an intentionally incorrect answer. For example, they would respond “A” to the comparison shown in Figure 10. Everyone would**
**agree that the lines were the same even though they were clearly different.**
**The subject, who was unaware of the ruse, would immediately become**
**bewildered. Their eyes would open wide. They would laugh nervously to**
**themselves. They would double-check the reactions of other participants. Their**
**agitation would grow as one person after another delivered the same incorrect**
**response. Soon, the subject began to doubt their own eyes. Eventually, they**
**delivered the answer they knew in their heart to be incorrect.**

**Humans are similar. There is tremendous internal pressure to comply with the**
**norms of the group. The reward of being accepted is often greater than the**
**reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth. Most days, we’d**
**rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.**
**The human mind knows how to get along with others. It wants to get along**
**with others. This is our natural mode. You can override it—you can choose to**
**ignore the group or to stop caring what other people think—but it takes work.**
**Running against the grain of your culture requires extra effort.**

**When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is**
**unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change**
**is very attractive.**

#### **Imitating the Powerful**


**Humans everywhere pursue power, prestige, and status. We want pins and**
**medallions on our jackets. We want President or Partner in our titles. We want to**
**be acknowledged, recognized, and praised. This tendency can seem vain, but**
**overall, it’s a smart move. Historically, a person with greater power and status**
**has access to more resources, worries less about survival, and proves to be a**
**more attractive mate.**

**This is one reason we care so much about the habits of highly effective**
**people. We try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire**
**success ourselves. Many of our daily habits are imitations of people we admire.**
**You replicate the marketing strategies of the most successful firms in your**
**industry. We imitate people we envy. High-status people enjoy the approval, respect, and praise of others. And that means if a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.**

**We are continually wondering “What will others think of me?” and altering our behavior based on the answer.**

**The Polgar sisters—the chess prodigies mentioned at the beginning of this**
**chapter—are evidence of the powerful and lasting impact social influences can**
**have on our behavior. The sisters practiced chess for many hours each day and**
**continued this remarkable effort for decades. But these habits and behaviors**
**maintained their attractiveness, in part, because they were valued by their**
**culture. From the praise of their parents to the achievement of different status**
**markers like becoming a grandmaster, they had many reasons to continue their effort.**

## **Chapter Summary**

- **The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us.**
- **We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture**
  **because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.**
- **We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family**
  **and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status**
  **and prestige).**
- **One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to**
  **join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior**
  **and (2) you already have something in common with the group.**
- **The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired**
  **behavior of the individual. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the**
  **crowd than be right by ourselves.**
- **If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it**
  **attractive.**
