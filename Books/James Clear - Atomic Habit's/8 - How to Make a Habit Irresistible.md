**Tinbergen discovered that the goose will pull any nearby round object, such as**
**a billiard ball or a light bulb, back into the nest. The bigger the object, the greater**
**their response. One goose even made a tremendous effort to roll a volleyball**
**back and sit on top. Like the baby gulls automatically pecking at red dots, the greylag goose was following an instinctive rule: When I see a round object nearby, I must roll it back  the nest. The bigger the round object, the harder I should try to get it.**
**It’s like the brain of each animal is preloaded with certain rules for behavior,**
**and when it comes across an exaggerated version of that rule, it lights up like a**
**Christmas tree. Scientists refer to these exaggerated cues as super normal stimuli.**
**A super normal stimulus is a heightened version of reality—like a beak with**
**three red dots or an egg the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a stronger**
**response than usual.** 

**Humans are also prone to fall for exaggerated versions of reality. Junk food,**
**for example, drives our reward systems into a frenzy. After spending hundreds**
**of thousands of years hunting and foraging for food in the wild, the human brain**
**has evolved to place a high value on salt, sugar, and fat.**

**The modern food industry, and the overeating habits it has spawned, is just**
**one example of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change: Make it attractive. The more**
**attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.**
**Look around. Society is filled with highly engineered versions of reality that**
**are more attractive than the world our ancestors evolved in.**

**Throughout our discussion of the 2nd Law, our goal is to learn**
**how to make our habits irresistible. While it is not possible to transform every**
**habit into a super normal stimulus, we can make any habit more enticing. To do**
**this, we must start by understanding what a craving is and how it works.**
**We begin by examining a biological signature that all habits share—the**
**dopamine spike.**

## **Dopamine-Driven Feedback Loop**

**In follow-up studies, other scientists also inhibited the dopamine-releasing**
**parts of the brain, but this time, they squirted little droplets of sugar into the**
**mouths of the dopamine-depleted rats. Their little rat faces lit up with**
**pleasurable grins from the tasty substance. Even though dopamine was blocked,**
**they liked the sugar just as much as before; they just didn’t want it anymore. The**
**ability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And**
**without desire, action stopped.**

**Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every behavior that is highly**
**habit-forming—taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, browsing**
**social media—is associated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be**
**said for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food, drinking water,**
**having sex, and interacting socially.**

**For years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but now we**
**know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including**
**motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion, and voluntary**
**movement.**

**When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released not**
**only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it. Gambling**
**addicts have a dopamine spike right before they place a bet, not after they win.**

**As a child, thinking about Christmas morning can be better than**
**opening the gifts. As an adult, daydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be**
**more enjoyable than actually being on vacation. Scientists refer to this as the**
**difference between “wanting” and “liking.”**

## **The Dopamine Spike**

**![[dopaminestrike.png]]**
**By comparison, the liking centers of the brain are much smaller. They are often referred to as “hedonic hot spots” and are distributed like tiny islands throughout the brain. For instance, researchers have found that 100 percent of the nucleus accumbens is activated**
**during wanting. Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structure is activated during**
**liking.**

**The fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the regions**
**responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence of the crucial role**
**these processes play. Desire is the engine that drives behavior. Every action is**
**taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to**
**the response.**

**These insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change. We**
**need to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation of a rewarding**
**experience that motivates us to act in the first place. This is where a strategy**
**known as temptation bundling comes into play.**

## **How To Use Temptation Bundling To Make Your Habits More Attractive**

**Ronan Byrne bundled watching Netflix (the thing he wanted to do) with riding his stationary bike (the thing he needed to do)**

**The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is:**

1. **After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].**

2. **After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].**


**If you want to check Facebook, but you need to exercise more:**

1. **After I pull out my phone, I will do ten burpees (need).**

2. **After I do ten burpees, I will check Facebook (want).**

**Engineering a truly irresistible habit is a hard task, but this simple strategy can be employed to make nearly any habit more attractive than it would be otherwise.**

## **Chapter Summary**

- **The 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive.**
- **The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become**
  **habit-forming.**
- **Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so**
  **does our motivation to act.**
- **It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us**
  **to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine**
  **spike.**
- **Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive.**
- **The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you**
  **need to do.**
