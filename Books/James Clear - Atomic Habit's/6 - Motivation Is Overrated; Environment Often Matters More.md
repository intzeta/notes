## **How To Design Your Environment For Success**

**It’s easy not to practice the guitar when it’s tucked away in the closet.**
**It’s easy not to read a book when the bookshelf is in the corner of the guest**
**room. It’s easy not to take your vitamins when they are out of sight in the pantry.**
**When the cues that spark a habit are subtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore.**

**Here are a few ways you can redesign your environment and make the cues**
**for your preferred habits more obvious:**

- **If you want to remember to take your medication each night, put your**
  **pill bottle directly next to the faucet on the bathroom counter.** 
- **If you want to practice guitar more frequently, place your guitar stand**
  **in the middle of the living room.**
- **If you want to remember to send more thank-you notes, keep a stack of**
  **stationery on your desk.**
- **If you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each**
  **morning and place them in common locations around the house.**

**Environment design is powerful not only because it influences how we engage**
**with the world but also because we rarely do it. Most people live in a world**
**others have created for them. But you can alter the spaces where you live and**
**work to increase your exposure to positive cues and reduce your exposure to**
**negative ones. Environment design allows you to take back control and become**
**the architect of your life. Be the designer of your world and not merely the**
**consumer of it.**

## **The Context Is The Cue**

**The cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits**
**become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context**
**surrounding the behavior.**

**We mentally assign our habits to the locations in which they occur: the home,**
**the office, the gym. Each location develops a connection to certain habits and**
**routines. You establish a particular relationship with the objects on your desk,**
**the items on your kitchen counter, the things in your bedroom. Our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.**

**In one study, scientists instructed insomniacs to get into bed only when they**
**were tired. If they couldn’t fall asleep, they were told to sit in a different room**
**until they became sleepy. Over time, subjects began to associate the context of**
**their bed with the action of sleeping, and it became easier to quickly fall asleep**
**when they climbed in bed. Their brains learned that sleeping—not browsing on**
**their phones, not watching television, not staring at the clock—was the only**
**action that happened in that room.**

**It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new**
**habit in the face of competing cues. It can be difficult to go to bed early if you**
**watch television in your bedroom each night. It can be hard to study in the living**
**room without getting distracted if that’s where you always play video games.**
**But when you step outside your normal environment**

**Trying to eat healthier? It is likely that you shop on autopilot at your regular**
**supermarket. Try a new grocery store. You may find it easier to avoid unhealthy**
**food when your brain doesn’t automatically know where it is located in the store.**
**When you can’t manage to get to an entirely new environment, redefine or**
**rearrange your current one. Create a separate space for work, study, exercise,**
**entertainment, and cooking. The mantra I find useful is “One space, one use.”**

**Was the couch where I relaxed or where I sent emails? Everything**
**happened in the same place. A few years later, I could finally afford to move to a home with a separate room for my office. Suddenly, work was something that happened “in here” and**
**personal life was something that happened “out there.” It was easier for me to**
**turn off the professional side of my brain when there was a clear dividing line**
**between work life and home life. Each room had one primary use. The kitchen**
**was for cooking. The office was for working.**

**I know a writer who uses his computer only for writing, his**
**tablet only for reading, and his phone only for social media and texting. Every**
**habit should have a home. Focus comes automatically when you are**
**sitting at your work desk. Relaxation is easier when you are in a space designed**
**for that purpose. Sleep comes quickly when it is the only thing that happens in**
**your bedroom.**

**A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an**
**environment where habits can easily form.**

## **Chapter Summary**

- **Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over**
  **time.**
- **Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that**
  **stand out.**
- **Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.**
- **Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but**
  **with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes**
  **the cue.**
- **It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are**
  **not fighting against old cues.**
