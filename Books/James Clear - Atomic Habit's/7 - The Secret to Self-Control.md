**Lee Robins was one of the researchers in charge. In a finding that completely**
**upended the accepted beliefs about addiction, Robins found that when soldiers**
**who had been heroin users returned home from Vietnam, only 5 percent of them became**
**re-addicted within a year, and just 12 percent relapsed within three years. In other**
**words, approximately nine out of ten soldiers who used heroin in Vietnam**
**eliminated their addiction nearly overnight.**
**This finding contradicted the prevailing view at the time, which considered**
**heroin addiction to be a permanent and irreversible condition. Instead, Robins**
**revealed that addictions could spontaneously dissolve if there was a radical**
**change in the environment.**

**Compare this situation to that of a typical drug user. Someone becomes addicted at home or with friends, goes to a clinic to get clean**

**If you’re overweight, a smoker, or an addict, you’ve been**
**told your entire life that it is because you lack self-control—maybe even that**
**you’re a bad person. The idea that a little bit of discipline would solve all our**
**problems is deeply embedded in our culture. Instead,**
**“disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not**
**require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in**
**tempting situations.**

**The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it**
**the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very**
**often. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the**
**way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined**
**person, but by creating a more disciplined environment. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment.**

**Shaming obese people with weight-loss presentations can make them**
**feel stressed, and as a result many people return to their favorite coping strategy:**
**overeating. Showing pictures of blackened lungs to smokers leads to higher**
**levels of anxiety, which drives many people to reach for a cigarette. If you’re not**
**careful about cues, you can cause the very behavior you want to stop. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad. Watching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don’t have the energy to do anything else. Worrying about your health makes you feel anxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety, which makes your health even worse and soon you’re feeling more**
**anxious. It’s a downward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits.**

**Here’s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it.**
**Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are**
**nearly impossible to remove entirely—even if they go unused for quite a while.**
**And that means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. It is**
**hard to maintain a Zen attitude in a life filled with interruptions. It takes too**
**much energy. In the short-run, you can choose to overpower temptation. In the**
**long-run, we become a product of the environment that we live in. To put it**
**bluntly, I have never seen someone consistently stick to positive habits in a**
**negative environment.**
**A more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. One of the**
**most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that**
**causes it.**

- **If you can’t seem to get any work done, leave your phone in another**
  **room for a few hours.**
- **If you’re continually feeling like you’re not enough, stop following**
  **social media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy.**
- **If you’re wasting too much time watching television, move the TV out**
  **of the bedroom.**
- **If you’re spending too much money on electronics, quit reading**
  **reviews of the latest tech gear.**
- **If you’re playing too many video games, unplug the console and put it**
  **in a closet after each use.**
