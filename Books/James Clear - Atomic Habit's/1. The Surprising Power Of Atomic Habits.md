## Why Small Habits Make A Big Difference?

**==To achieve any goal, we put pressure on ourselves to==
==make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.==
Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it
isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far ==more meaningful, especially in the long run.== The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. ==If you can get 1% better each day for one year, you'll end up 37 times better by the time you're done.==**

**1% better or 1% worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations. ==Good habits make time your ally.==

==**All big things come from small beginnings.== The seed of every habit is a
single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows
stronger. Roots entrench themselves and branches grow

### **Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.
Goal setting suffers from a serious case of survivor ship bias. We concentrate on
the people who end up winning—the survivors—and mistakenly assume that
ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the people who had
the same objective but didn’t succeed.
	Every Olympian wants to win a gold medal. Every candidate wants to get the
job. And if successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the
goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers. It wasn’t the goal
of winning the Tour de France that propelled the British cyclists to the top of the
sport. Presumably, they had wanted to win the race every year before—just like
every other professional team. The goal had always been there. It was only when
they implemented a system of continuous small improvements that they achieved
a different outcome.


### **Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.
Imagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you summon
the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room—for now. But if you
maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a messy room in the first
place, soon you’ll be looking at a new pile of clutter and hoping for another burst
of motivation. You’re left chasing the same outcome because you never changed
the system behind it. You treated a symptom without addressing the cause.
	Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That’s the
counter intuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our
results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are
the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need
to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix
themselves.

### **Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.
The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll
be happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually
putting happiness off until the next milestone. I’ve slipped into this trap so many
times I’ve lost count. For years, happiness was always something for my future
self to enjoy. I promised myself that once I gained twenty pounds of muscle or
after my business was featured in the New York Times, then I could finally relax.
	Furthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal
and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box
yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. It is unlikely that
your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when
you set out. It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when
there are many paths to success.
A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the
process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself
permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.
And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you
first envision.

### **Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.
Finally, a goal-oriented mind-set can create a “yo-yo” effect. Many runners work
hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. The
race is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused
on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is
why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after
accomplishing a goal.
	The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building
systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less
thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of
endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your
commitment to the process that will determine your progress.

**Chapter Summary
 - **Habits are the compound interest of selfimprovement. Getting 1
   percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.
-  **Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against
   you, which is why understanding the details is essential.
-  **Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a
   critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding
   process are delayed. You need to be patient.
-  **An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as
   atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the
   building blocks of remarkable results.
-  **If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on
   your system instead.
-  **You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your
   systems.
