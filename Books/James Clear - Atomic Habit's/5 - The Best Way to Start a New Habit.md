## **Habit at time**

**The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this**
**sentence:**
**I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].**
**Meditation. I will meditate for one minute at 7 a.m. in my kitchen.**
**Studying. I will study Spanish for twenty minutes at 6 p.m. in my**
**bedroom.**
**Exercise. I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. in my local gym.**
**Marriage. I will make my partner a cup of tea at 8 a.m. in the kitchen.**

**Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal is to make**
**the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to**
**do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why.** 
**As the writer Jason Zweig noted,** 

> **“Obviously you’re never going to just work out without**
> **conscious thought. But like a dog salivating at a bell, maybe you start to get**
> **antsy around the time of day you normally work out.”**

## **Habit Stacking**


**The habit stacking formula is:**

**“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”**

**For example:**
- **Meditation. After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will**
  **meditate for one minute.**
- **Exercise. After I take off my work shoes, I will immediately change**
  **into my workout clothes.**
- **Gratitude. After I sit down to dinner, I will say one thing I’m grateful**
  **for that happened today.**
- **Marriage. After I get into bed at night, I will give my partner a kiss.**
- **Safety. After I put on my running shoes, I will text a friend or family**
  **member where I am running and how long it will take.**

**Your morning routine habit stack might look like this:**

1. **After I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will meditate for sixty**
   **seconds.**
2. **After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do list for the**
   **day.**
3. **After I write my to-do list for the day, I will immediately begin my**
   **first task.**

**Or, consider this habit stack in the evening:**
1. **After I finish eating dinner, I will put my plate directly into the**
   **dishwasher.**
2. **After I put my dishes away, I will immediately wipe down the counter.**
3. **After I wipe down the counter, I will set out my coffee mug for**
   **tomorrow morning.**

**Once you get comfortable with this approach, you can develop general habit stacks to guide you whenever the situation is appropriate:**

- **Exercise. When I see a set of stairs, I will take them instead of using**
  **the elevator.**
- **Social skills. When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to**
  **someone I don’t know yet.**
- **Finances. When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait**
  **twenty-four hours before purchasing.**
- **Healthy eating. When I serve myself a meal, I will always put veggies**
  **on my plate first.**
- **Minimalism. When I buy a new item, I will give something away.**
  **(“One in, one out.”)**
- **Mood. When the phone rings, I will take one deep breath and smile**
  **before answering.**
- **Forgetfulness. When I leave a public place, I will check the table and**
  **chairs to make sure I don’t leave anything behind.**

**One way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming a list**
**of your current habits. You can use your Habits Scorecard from the last chapter**
**as a starting point. Alternatively, you can create a list with two columns. In the**
**first column, write down the habits you do each day without fail.***

- **For example:**
- **Get out of bed.**
- **Take a shower.**
- **Brush your teeth.**
- **Get dressed.**
- **Brew a cup of coffee.**
- **Eat breakfast.**
- **Take the kids to school.**
- **Start the work day.**
- **Eat lunch.**
- **End the work day.**
- **Change out of work clothes.**
- **Sit down for dinner.**
- **Turn off the lights.**
- **Get into bed.**

**Your list can be much longer, but you get the idea. In the second column,**
**write down all of the things that happen to you each day without fail. For**
**example:**

- **The sun rises.**
- **You get a text message.**
- **The song you are listening to ends.**
- **The sun sets.**

## **Chapter Summary**

- **The 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious.**
  **The two most common cues are time and location.**
- **Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a**
  **new habit with a specific time and location.**
- **The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at**
  **[TIME] in [LOCATION].**
- **Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a**
  **current habit.**
- **The habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will**
  **[NEW HABIT].**
