## **Three Layers of Behavior Change
![[threelayersofbehaviorchange.png]]
	==*The first layer is changing your outcomes.== This level is concerned with
changing your results: losing weight, publishing a book, winning a
championship. Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of change.
	==The second layer is changing your process.== This level is concerned with
changing your habits and systems: implementing a new routine at the gym,
decluttering your desk for better workflow, developing a meditation practice.
Most of the habits you build are associated with this level.
	==The third and deepest layer is changing your identity.== This level is
concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your
judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and
biases you hold are associated with this level.

## **The Two-Step Process To Changing Your Identity

**If you practice playing the guitar, perhaps you are the type of person who likes music.
Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No
single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. habits are the path to changing your
identity.

**It is a simple two-step process:
1.  **Decide the type of person you want to be.
2.  **Prove it to yourself with small wins.

**For example, “Who is the type of person who could write a book?” It’s
probably someone who is consistent and reliable. Now your focus shifts from
writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person who is consistent
and reliable (identity-based).

- **“I’m the kind of teacher who stands up for her students.”
- **“I’m the kind of doctor who gives each patient the time and empathy
  they need.”
- **“I’m the kind of manager who advocates for her employees.”

**“What would a healthy person do?” All day long, she would use this question as a guide. Would a healthy person walk or take a cab? Would a healthy person order a burrito or a salad? She figured if she acted like a healthy person long enough, eventually she would become that person. She was right. The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome.

## **Chapter Summary
- **There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and**
  **identity change.**
- **The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what**
  **you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.**
- **Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the**
  **type of person you wish to become.**
- **Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously**
  **edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.**
- **The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better**
  **results (although they can do that), but because they can change your**
  **beliefs about yourself.**
