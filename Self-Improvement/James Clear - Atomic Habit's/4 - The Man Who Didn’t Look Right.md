## **Invisible Habit**

**This is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: you don’t need to**
**be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an opportunity and take**
**action without dedicating conscious attention to it. This is what makes habits**
**useful. It’s also what makes them dangerous.**
    
**Over time, the cues that spark our habits become so common that they are**
**essentially invisible: the treats on the kitchen counter, the remote control next to**
**the couch, the phone in our pocket. Our responses to these cues are so deeply**
**encoded that ==it may feel like the urge to act comes from nowhere. For this==**
**==reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness.==**
	**Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our**
**current ones. This can be more challenging than it sounds because once a habit is**
**firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly nonconscious and automatic. If a habit**
**remains mindless, you can’t expect to improve it. As the psychologist Carl Jung**
**said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you**
**will call it fate.”**

## **The Habits Scorecard**


**One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of**
**what we are actually doing. This helps explain why the consequences of bad**
**habits can sneak up on us. ==We need a “point-and-call” system for our personal==**
**==lives. That’s the origin of the Habits Scorecard, which is a simple exercise you==**
**==can use to become more aware of your behavior. To create your own, make a list==**
**==of your daily habits.==**
	**Here’s a sample of where your list might start:**

- **Wake up**
- **Turn off alarm**
- **Check my phone**
- **Go to the bathroom**
- **Weigh myself**
- **Take a shower**
- **Brush my teeth**
- **Floss my teeth**
- **Put on deodorant**
- **Hang up towel to dry**
- **Get dressed**
- **Make a cup of tea**

**. . . and so on.**
	**Once you have a full list, look at each behavior, and ask yourself, “Is this a**
**good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?” If it is a good habit, write “+” next to**
**it. If it is a bad habit, write “–”. If it is a neutral habit, write “=”.**
	**For example, the list above might look like this:**

- **Wake up =**
- **Turn off alarm =**
- **Check my phone –**
- **Go to the bathroom =**
- **Weigh myself +**
- **Take a shower +**
- **Brush my teeth +**
- **Floss my teeth +**
- **Put on deodorant +**
- **Hang up towel to dry =**
- **Get dressed =**
- **Make a cup of tea +**

**The marks you give to a particular habit will depend on your situation and**
**your goals. For someone who is trying to lose weight, eating a bagel with peanut**
**butter every morning might be a bad habit. For someone who is trying to bulk up**
**and add muscle, the same behavior might be a good habit. It all depends on what**
**you’re working toward.**

**The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them. If you***
**feel like you need extra help, then you can try Pointing-and-Calling in your own**
**life. Say out loud the action that you are thinking of taking and what the outcome**
**will be.**

  **certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.**
- **Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what**
  **we are doing.**
- **The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You**
  **need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.**
- **Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a**
  **nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your**
  **actions.**
- **The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more**
