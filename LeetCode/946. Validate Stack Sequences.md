Given two integer arrays `pushed` and `popped` each with distinct values, return `true` _if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack, or_ `false` _otherwise._

**Example 1:**

`Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
`Output: true
**Explanation:** We might do the following sequence:
`push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4),
`pop() -> 4,
`push(5),
`pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1

**Example 2:**

`Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]
`Output: false
`Explanation: 1 cannot be popped before 2.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= pushed.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= pushed[i] <= 1000`
- All the elements of `pushed` are **unique**.
- `popped.length == pushed.length`
- `popped` is a permutation of `pushed`.

### Answer And Explanations

- We create a stack to push all the element's, then we iterate through the array of pushed. With every iteration we push the element to stack and if the stack Top value is equal to value in the Array `'popped'` we pop it and add one to the variable `'j'`

```
class Solution {
	public:
		bool validateStackSequences(vector<int>& pushed, vector<int>& popped) {
			stack<int> stack;
			int j = 0;
			for(int i = 0; i < pushed.size(); i++){
				stack.push(pushed[i]);
				while(!stack.empty() && stack.top() == popped[j]){
					j++;
					stack.pop();
				}
			}
			return stack.empty();
		}
};
```
