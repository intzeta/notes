[344. Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)
[[Strings]]
[[Two Pointers]]

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.

**Example 1:**

`Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
`Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

**Example 2:**

`Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
`Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s[i]` is a printable ascii character.'

##### Answer And Explanation

- We start by creating variables `start` and `end`, they will be our Indexes. Then we loop until the start is not bigger than end, that allows us to iterate through the Array. Then we create a temp variable that help us by storing the value `s[end]`. Then we swap the value from Index start and end.
 
```
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = s.size() - 1;

        while(start < end){
            char temp = s[end];
            s[end--] = s[start];
            s[start++] = temp;
        }
    }
};
```
