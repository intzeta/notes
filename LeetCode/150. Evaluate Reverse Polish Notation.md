You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents an arithmetic expression in a [Reverse Polish Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

Evaluate the expression. Return _an integer that represents the value of the expression_.

**Note** that:

- The valid operators are `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.
- Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
- The division between two integers always **truncates toward zero**.
- There will not be any division by zero.
- The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
- The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a **32-bit** integer.

**Example 1:**

`Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
`Output: 9
`Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9

**Example 2:**

`Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
`Output: 6
`Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6

**Example 3:**


`Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
`Output: 22
`Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
`= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
`= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
`= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
`= (0 + 17) + 5
`= 17 + 5
`= 22

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= tokens.length <= 104`
- `tokens[i]` is either an operator: `"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, or `"/"`, or an integer in the range `[-200, 200]`.

### Answer And Explanation


- Because Reversed Polish notation looks like this: `<operand><operand><operator>` we can use Stack for this question. We will push number until there is a operator `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'` we will convert the numbers from string to integer using the function `'stoi()'` and push them into the stack. If there is a operator we will take the first two numbers from the Top stack and assign them to variables `'num1'` and `'num2'`. Then we will do the operation according to the operator. After that we will push that number into the stack again. At the end we are left with one number, the answer and that is what we gonna return.

```
class Solution {
	public:
		int evalRPN(vector<string>& tokens) {
			stack<int> s;
			for(int i = 0; i < tokens.size(); i++){
				if(tokens[i] != "+" && tokens[i] != "-" &&
				   tokens[i] != "*" && tokens[i] != "/"){
						s.push(stoi(tokens[i]));
				}else{
					int num1 = s.top(); s.pop();
					int num2 = s.top(); s.pop();
					
					if(tokens[i] == "+") s.push(num2 + num1);
					if(tokens[i] == "-") s.push(num2 - num1);
					if(tokens[i] == "*") s.push(num2 * num1);
					if(tokens[i] == "/") s.push(num2 / num1);
				}
			}
			return s.top();
		}
};
```
